For my tests I used the glider cell example, fish, and plus in both the flat grid and torus grid formations.
For the glider in the flat grid format, the 5 dots that are alive move down and right until it hits the wall and becomes a 4 cell square.
For the glider in the torus grid format, the 5 dots that are alive move down and right then continue moving around the left side of the map.
For the fish in the flat grid format, the live cells move towards the right wall, then when it collides it forms a structure that goes up to the top of the map, where it finally becomes a 4 cell square.
For the fish in the torus grid format, the live cells move towards the right wall, then it continues on through the left wall in an infinite pattern.
For the plus in the flat grid, the plus sign goes through many transformations and by generation 30 the plus forms a smaller plus in the center of the map with a missing cell in the middle. It does the same exact thing for the torus map, because it does not ever reach the wall.
